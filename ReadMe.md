# Django-Project

Django-Project is an example of a basic web application developed using Django: a high level Python web framework. This is my small step towards learning and sharing my knowledge with the world.

# What does this website do?

1. An admin View: The administrator can modify the content
2. A public view: The public view of website lets people to view the website.

# How does this web application will look like after you have finished the steps explained in [Project Set Up](https://github.com/supriya-s-jadhav/Django-Project/blob/master/ProjectSetUp.md) ?

This is the basic view of the website. It is intended for learning purposes hence it's developed with very simple design. The website content and view are subject to change in future as I develop it further.
